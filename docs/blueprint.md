## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#2962FF), a professional but not-too-corporate color implying knowledge, confidence and stability. This primary hue aims for a midpoint on the formality spectrum.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F5FF), of similar hue to the primary but unsaturated and bright for a calm, clean feel.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#C04CFF), highlighting energy, originality, and expressiveness.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Space Grotesk provides a tech-forward aesthetic, and Inter brings a clean and readable feel to the content.
- Line icons, related to career development and job searching, to illustrate the core features.
- Clean and modern layout, with a focus on readability and user experience.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement and provide feedback.
